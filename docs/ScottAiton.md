Some notes from the meeting:
- Mike from HomeCU gave an overview of internal tool:
    - cuinfo displays a table of credit unions. Clicking on a specific credit
    union will show things like contact information
    - Loan Application Form tool is a tool for creating loan application forms
        - Allows user to add fields for things like description of loan, information about the loan applicant, etc.
        - For each field, the user creating the form has to set some attributes.
- HomeCU will be providing a docker container for us to develop in. It will contain a database loaded with example information.
- We will meet every Thursday at 1:30pm on Google Meet.
