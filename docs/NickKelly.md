Met with the team to get a better understanding schedule for the rest of the semester. Wrote an outline for the team-created schedule for the semester. Will need to meet with the team/instructor/sponsor to make sure the schedule is not missing anything.

### February 7, 2020

Applied the github patch that the sponsor provided to the repository.

## Week 4

### February 10, 2020

I spent time installing docker and understanding the environment. I ran into a lot of issue when installing docker but was able to overcome most of them. The main issue that I faced was that my computer does not support Hyper-V. This feature is only in Windows 10 Pro and Enterprise editions. I had to use Docker Toolbox instead of the main docker program. From what I can see Docker Toolbox works fine with the provide docker container. I will discuss with the other team members about how their docker setup went tomorrow.

### February 11, 2020

Turns out the previous attempts at getting docker to work on my machine were not successful, but I was able to get it working. Instead of using Docker Toolbox on my Windows 10 environment I used a VM running Ubuntu. This worked flawlessly. I used a guide by Nick Janetakis to [set up the VM](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/create-an-awesome-linux-development-environment-in-windows-with-vmware) and to [get docker setup](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/docker-tip-73-connecting-to-a-remote-docker-daemon).

### February 12, 2020

Updated the main README.md of the repository to match our schedule and added directories to /labs to match the updated schedule.
